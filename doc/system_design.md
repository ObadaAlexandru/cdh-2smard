The 2smard_activator is an application responsible for activating the 2smard system according to an activation sequence. The sequence is given as a list of action Activate/Deactivate with the duration the system must be in the respective state (e.g. Activate for 2 seconds, Deactivate for 5 seconds, Activate for 1 minute etc.). The activation/deactivation of 2smard is controlled via the EPS daemon, which supplies it with power. The EPS daemon exposes the switch functions via dbus (switchOn, switchOff), these functions are triggered accordingly by the activator. The activation sequences can be provided in multiple ways: via command line interface with --config=<sequence> or via the configuration file. The sequence is expected to be in the following form `A5s|I2s|A45s|I1m`, it is tokenized on the pipe symbol `|` and converted in a list of SequenceItems, objects which contain a state and a duration. Each sequence item list is passed to an EpsCaller instance, which is responsible of triggering the EPS dbus service. Each EpsCaller runs in a separate thread, and is responsible of one of the two 2smard halfs.
